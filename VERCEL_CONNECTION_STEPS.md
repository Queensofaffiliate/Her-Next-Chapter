# üéØ CONNECT YOUR CODE TO VERCEL PROJECT

Great! You created "Her Next Chapter" project in Vercel. Now you need to connect your local code to it.

## CURRENT SITUATION
- ‚úÖ Vercel project "Her Next Chapter" created
- ‚ùå Your code is still only on your computer
- ‚ùå Vercel can't see your code yet

## SOLUTION: Push Code to GitHub First

Your git commands are ALMOST correct! Here's the exact sequence:

### STEP 1: Initialize Git (if not done already)
```bash
# In your project folder:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
```

### STEP 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to github.com
2. Click **"New repository"**
3. Name it: **"her-next-chapter"**
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### STEP 3: Connect & Push
GitHub will show you commands like this:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/her-next-chapter.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### STEP 4: Import to Your Vercel Project
1. In Vercel, go to your "Her Next Chapter" project
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Git
3. Click **"Connect Git Repository"**
4. Select your "her-next-chapter" repo
5. Click **"Connect"**

## RESULT: Auto-deployment! üöÄ

After connecting, any code changes you push to GitHub will automatically deploy to Vercel.

**Your commands are correct - you just need the GitHub repo created first!**
