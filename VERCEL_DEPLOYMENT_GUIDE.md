# ðŸš€ GET YOUR PROJECT INTO VERCEL

## WHY YOU DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN VERCEL YET

You're signed into Vercel correctly! The reason you don't see your project is because **your code is only on your computer** - it needs to be on GitHub first so Vercel can access it.

## QUICK FIX: 3 STEPS TO GET LIVE

### STEP 1: Put Your Code on GitHub (3 minutes)

**Option A: Use GitHub Desktop (Easier)**
1. Download GitHub Desktop app
2. Click "Add an Existing Repository from your Hard Drive"
3. Select your project folder
4. Click "Publish repository to GitHub"
5. Name it "her-next-chapter"
6. Click "Publish"

**Option B: Use Command Line**
```bash
# In your project folder:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Go to github.com â†’ New Repository â†’ Name it "her-next-chapter"
# Then copy the commands GitHub gives you (like this):
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/her-next-chapter.git
git push -u origin main
```

### STEP 2: Import to Vercel (1 minute)
1. Go back to Vercel dashboard
2. Click **"Add New..."** â†’ **"Project"**
3. You'll now see your GitHub repos!
4. Find "her-next-chapter" â†’ Click **"Import"**
5. Click **"Deploy"** (Vercel auto-detects everything)

### STEP 3: Add Environment Variables (1 minute)
After deployment, go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables:

Add these 2 variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://aukemeyyxbbyralenfra.supabase.co`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImF1a2VtZXl5eGJieXJhbGVuZnJhIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTMwOTQ5NzYsImV4cCI6MjA2ODY3MDk3Nn0.lfGANB8jONVzVWmQnJCDMonrzX-xJmsJ9ecRVTbGl6k`

Click "Save" â†’ "Redeploy"

## RESULT: Your app will be live! ðŸŽ‰

**Timeline:** 5 minutes total
**Live URL:** `https://her-next-chapter-[random].vercel.app`

The hardest part is just getting the code from your computer to GitHub - after that, Vercel makes deployment automatic!
